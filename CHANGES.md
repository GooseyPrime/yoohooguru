## Notes
1. The implementation includes placeholder components for Stripe, Agora, and Google Maps integrations that would need to be connected to actual API keys and backend services in a production environment.
2. Webhook handlers are implemented but would need to be configured with actual Stripe webhook secrets in production.
3. Video conferencing components are implemented but would need actual Agora App ID and token generation in production.
4. Google Maps components are implemented but would need actual API keys and geolocation services in production.
5. AI assessment components are implemented but would need actual OpenRouter API integration in production.
6. Example category pages were created for 8 of the 24 subdomains. The same pattern can be followed to create the remaining 16 category pages.
7. All components are designed to be responsive and follow consistent styling patterns.
8. User roles are implemented in the authentication system and enforced on role-specific pages.
