# Jam.dev Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Jam.dev screen recording and event capture functionality across all pages and subdomains of the yoohoo.guru platform.

## What Was Added

### Jam.dev Scripts
The following scripts were added to the global `_document.tsx` file, making them available on every page:

```html
<!-- Lets users record their screen from your site -->
<meta name="jam:team" content="7a93cd08-992a-4acf-8f73-72dea0a67c7b" />
<script type="module" src="https://js.jam.dev/recorder.js"></script>

<!-- Captures user events and developer logs -->
<script type="module" src="https://js.jam.dev/capture.js"></script>
```

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
- **`apps/main/pages/_document.tsx`** - Added Jam.dev scripts to the global HTML head

### Coverage
✅ **Main Domain**: yoohoo.guru  
✅ **All 28 Subdomains**: art.yoohoo.guru, tech.yoohoo.guru, business.yoohoo.guru, etc.  
✅ **All Pages**: Home, blog posts, user profiles, admin pages, auth pages, etc.  
✅ **All Environments**: Development, staging, and production

### Architecture
- **Single Implementation**: Added to `_document.tsx` which controls the HTML structure for all pages
- **Middleware Routing**: The existing subdomain middleware routes requests to appropriate pages, but all share the same document structure
- **No Conflicts**: Individual pages using `Head` components only add page-specific meta tags and don't override the global scripts

## Technical Verification

### Build Status
✅ **Build Success**: Application compiles without errors  
✅ **Type Checking**: No TypeScript errors  
✅ **Linting**: No ESLint warnings  
✅ **All Routes**: 30+ pages build successfully including all subdomains
