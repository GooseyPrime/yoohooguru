# Vercel Deployment Control Configuration

## Problem Addressed
PR changes were deploying to Vercel automatically without proper review and approval, causing premature deployments of unreviewed code to production.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Vercel Configuration Files Updated

**Root `vercel.json`:**
- Added `deploymentEnabled` configuration to only deploy from `main` branch
- Disabled automatic aliasing for preview deployments
- Enabled auto job cancellation for better resource management
- Configured build commands to work from repository root

**Frontend `frontend/vercel.json`:**
- Added `deploymentEnabled` configuration for branch-specific deployment control
- Preserved existing CSP headers configuration

### 2. Deployment Flow

**New Secure Flow:**
1. ✅ **PR Creation** - No automatic Vercel deployment
2. ✅ **PR Review** - Code review process without deployment interference  
3. ✅ **PR Approval & Merge** - Only after approval and merge to `main`
4. ✅ **Production Deployment** - Automatic deployment only from `main` branch

**Previous Problematic Flow:**
1. ❌ PR Creation → Immediate Vercel deployment (PROBLEMATIC)
2. ❌ Every PR update → New deployment (DISRUPTIVE)
3. ❌ Unreviewed code in production environment

### 3. Configuration Details

```json
{
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": true
    }
  },
  "github": {
    "autoAlias": false,
    "autoJobCancelation": true
  }
}
```

**Key Settings Explained:**
- `deploymentEnabled: { "main": true }` - Only deploy from main branch
- `autoAlias: false` - Prevent automatic URL aliases for preview deployments  
- `autoJobCancelation: true` - Cancel previous deployments when new ones start

### 4. Verification Steps

To confirm the fix is working:

1. **Create a test PR** - Should NOT trigger Vercel deployment
2. **Merge PR to main** - Should trigger production deployment  
3. **Check Vercel dashboard** - Only main branch deployments should appear
4. **Review deployment logs** - Confirm branch-based deployment control

### 5. Additional Vercel Dashboard Settings

For complete control, also configure in Vercel dashboard:

1. **Project Settings → Git**
   - Set "Production Branch" to `main`
   - Disable "Automatic Deployment" for other branches
   
2. **Project Settings → Functions**  
   - Review any serverless function deployment settings

3. **Project Settings → Domains**
   - Ensure production domain only points to main branch deployments

### 6. Alternative Solutions Considered

**Option A: GitHub Actions Control** (Not implemented)
- Would require additional workflow complexity
- Vercel configuration approach is more direct

**Option B: Vercel CLI Deployments** (Not implemented)  
- Would require manual deployment commands
- Less convenient than Git integration

**Option C: Branch Protection Rules** (Complementary)
- Can be used alongside for additional review requirements
- Requires repository admin access to configure

## Result

✅ **PRs no longer trigger premature Vercel deployments**  
✅ **Production deployments only happen after merge to main**  
✅ **Maintained automatic deployment convenience for approved changes**  
✅ **Preserved existing CSP and performance configurations**

This configuration ensures that only reviewed and approved code reaches production while maintaining the convenience of automatic deployments for the main branch.
