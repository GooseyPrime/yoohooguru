# Authentication & Onboarding UX Testing Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing instructions for the upgraded authentication and onboarding experience, which now supports dual roles (users can be both teachers and learners).

## Key Changes to Test

### 1. Dual-Role Selection
- Users are no longer forced to choose between being a teacher OR a learner
- Users can select both "Teach & Share Skills" and "Learn & Find Services"
- At least one option must be selected to proceed

### 2. Enhanced UX Features
- Password strength indicator with real-time feedback
- Social proof messaging
- Benefits list
- Improved error messages
- Hover animations and visual feedback

## Test Scenarios

4. Profile updates
5. Account management features

## Accessibility Testing

1. **Keyboard Navigation:**

   - Verify error messages are announced
   - Verify form labels are properly associated

   - Error messages are readable
   - Selected states are clear

## Performance Testing

1. **Page Load:**
   - Signup page should load quickly
   - No JavaScript errors in console
   - Service worker caches assets

2. **Form Responsiveness:**

   - Role card selection should respond immediately
   - No lag in validation messages

## Mobile Testing

2. Android (Chrome)
3. Tablet devices

**Mobile-Specific Checks:**
- Role cards stack vertically on narrow screens

   - Ensure popup blockers don't interfere
   - Verify fallback messaging works

2. **Firebase Initialization:**
   - Verify Firebase config is loaded
   - Check for initialization errors in console

3. **CORS Issues:**
   - Verify backend API calls succeed
   - Check browser network tab for CORS errors

4. **State Management:**
   - Role selections persist during form filling
   - Password strength updates correctly
   - Error messages clear when fields are corrected
