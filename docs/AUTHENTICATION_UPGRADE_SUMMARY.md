- Support tickets about dual roles

## Solution Implemented

### Core Changes

#### 1. Dual-Role Selection System
**Before:** Binary choice between "Skill Sharer" OR "Service Seeker"

- **Social Proof Banner**: "Join thousands of community members" with FREE badge
- **Benefits List**: Clear value proposition with 4 key benefits
- **Hover Animations**: Cards elevate and change color on interaction
- **Visual Checkmarks**: Selected roles show clear checkmark indicators

#### 3. Enhanced Messaging
- Prominent statement: "You can be both a teacher and a learner!"
- Helpful tip: "üí° Most users select both!"
- Educational message on login page
- Clear role descriptions

#### 4. Improved Validation
- Better error messages with specific guidance
- Password strength requirements (score > 2)
- Real-time validation feedback
- Name length validation (min 2 chars)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model Change
```javascript
// Old (Binary)
userType: 'skill_sharer' | 'service_poster'
