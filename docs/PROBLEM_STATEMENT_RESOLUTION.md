# Problem Statement Response - Complete Analysis

**Original Problem Statement:**
> "Many features and modules are missing that i know I've either given instruction to include or i have seen already functional and working. This means 1) either the links are now broken and not functional or 2) the code has been completely removed, or 3) they are orphaned for some other reason. Review the links on each page and subdomain page from top to bottom and check the linkages. Review each card or reactive block or item on any page and review their purpose and intended function. Review the ai agent's news article and blog outputs on each subdomain page (hint: they don't exist yet). Review the user dashboard, bookings, and listings interfaces and profile updating flows. Review user flow for each and every activity a user may perform on the site and implement anything missing or nonfunctional. Make sure to review the existing repo, and past pr work, to investigate missing code or functions so that nothing is duplicated or conflicting."
