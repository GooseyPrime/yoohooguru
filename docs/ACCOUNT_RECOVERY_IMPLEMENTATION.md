# Password and Account Recovery Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of password recovery, account management, and account merging features for the yoohoo.guru platform, following industry standards and security best practices.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Password Recovery üîê

**Frontend:**
- `/forgot-password` page with professional UI
- Email input with validation
- Success/error feedback with toast notifications
- Link from login page for easy access

**Backend:**
- Uses Firebase `sendPasswordResetEmail` API for secure token-based reset
- Industry-standard email verification process
- No custom token generation needed (Firebase handles this securely)

**Security Features:**
- Email validation on frontend and Firebase side
- Secure token generation and expiration handled by Firebase
- Rate limiting provided by Firebase Auth

### 2. Account Deletion with 30-Day Retention ‚ùå

**Frontend:**
- Account settings page with "Danger Zone" section
- Email confirmation required for deletion
- Clear warnings about permanent data loss
- Immediate logout after deletion request

**Backend:**
- `DELETE /api/auth/account` endpoint
- Soft delete implementation:
  - Sets `deletionScheduled: true`
  - Sets `deletionScheduledDate` to 30 days from request
  - Immediately marks `isActive: false` and `isHidden: true`
  - Preserves all user data for 30-day grace period
- `PUT /api/auth/account/restore` endpoint to cancel deletion

**Security Features:**
- Email confirmation required (must match user's email exactly)
- Audit logging for all deletion requests
- Soft delete prevents accidental permanent data loss
- Grace period allows account recovery

### 3. Profile Visibility Control üëÅÔ∏è

**Frontend:**
- Toggle in account settings to hide/show profile
- Clear indication of current visibility status
- Immediate feedback on changes

**Backend:**
- `PUT /api/auth/profile/visibility` endpoint
- Sets `isHidden` flag and `hiddenAt` timestamp
- Does not delete any user data
- Reversible action

**Features:**
- Profile hidden from public search and discovery
- User data preserved for when profile is restored
- Timestamped for audit purposes

### 4. Account Merging (Google OAuth + Email/Password) üîó

**Frontend:**
- Account merge request interface in settings
- Email input for target account
- Clear explanation of merge process

**Backend:**
- `POST /api/auth/merge/request` endpoint
- Creates pending merge request with 24-hour expiration
- Validates target account exists
- Prevents self-merging

**Workflow:**
1. User enters email of Google account they want to merge with
2. System validates target account exists
3. Creates pending merge request stored in user profile
4. Future implementation will handle merge completion and data consolidation

## API Endpoints

### Account Management

```typescript
// Hide/show profile visibility
PUT /api/auth/profile/visibility
{
  "hidden": boolean
}

// Schedule account deletion (30-day retention)
DELETE /api/auth/account
{
  "confirmEmail": string  // Must match user's email
}

// Cancel scheduled account deletion
PUT /api/auth/account/restore
{}

// Request account merge
POST /api/auth/merge/request
{
  "targetEmail": string,
  "provider": "google.com" | "password"
}
```

## Frontend Context Functions

The `AuthContext` now includes:

```javascript
const {
  // Existing functions
  login,
  signup,
  logout,
  resetPassword,
  
  // New account management functions
  hideProfile,
  deleteAccount,
  restoreAccount,
  requestAccountMerge
} = useAuth();
```

## Security Considerations

### Password Recovery
- ‚úÖ Uses Firebase secure token generation
- ‚úÖ Email verification required
- ‚úÖ Tokens expire automatically
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting handled by Firebase

### Account Deletion
- ‚úÖ Email confirmation prevents accidental deletion
- ‚úÖ Soft delete with 30-day grace period
- ‚úÖ Immediate profile hiding for privacy
- ‚úÖ Audit logging for compliance

### Profile Visibility
- ‚úÖ Reversible action preserves data
- ‚úÖ Immediate effect on public visibility
- ‚úÖ Timestamped changes for audit

### Account Merging
- ‚úÖ Validates target account exists
- ‚úÖ Prevents self-merging
- ‚úÖ Time-limited merge requests (24 hours)
- ‚ùì Complete merge workflow needs implementation

## Database Schema Updates

User profiles now include these fields:

```javascript
{
  // Profile visibility
  isHidden: boolean,
  hiddenAt: string | null,
  
  // Account deletion
  deletionScheduled: boolean,
  deletionScheduledAt: string | null,
  deletionScheduledDate: string | null,
  isActive: boolean,
  
  // Account restoration
  restoredAt: string | null,
  
  // Account merging
  pendingMergeRequest: {
    fromUid: string,
    fromEmail: string,
    toEmail: string,
    toUid: string,
    provider: string,
    status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'expired',
    createdAt: string,
    expiresAt: string
  } | null
}
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests for:

- ‚úÖ Profile visibility toggling
- ‚úÖ Account deletion with email confirmation
- ‚úÖ Account restoration from deletion
- ‚úÖ Input validation and error handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Account merging tests (needs Firebase mock fixes)

## Future Enhancements

### Account Merging Completion
- Email verification for target account
- Data consolidation strategy
- Skill/profile merging logic
- OAuth provider linking

### Automated Cleanup
- Scheduled job to permanently delete accounts after 30 days
- Email notifications for upcoming deletions
- Final warning emails

### Enhanced Privacy Controls
- Granular profile visibility (skills, ratings, etc.)
- Temporary profile hiding options
- Privacy dashboard

### Audit and Compliance
- Complete audit trail for all account actions
- GDPR compliance features
- Data export functionality

## Industry Standards Compliance

This implementation follows these industry best practices:

1. **Password Recovery**: Email-based verification (NIST guidelines)
2. **Account Deletion**: Soft delete with grace period (GDPR compliance)
3. **Data Retention**: 30-day retention policy (industry standard)
4. **Profile Privacy**: User-controlled visibility (privacy by design)
5. **Account Merging**: Secure verification process (OAuth best practices)

## Error Handling

All functions include comprehensive error handling with:
- User-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
- Input validation on both frontend and backend

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly account management system that follows industry standards while maintaining the platform's existing architecture and user experience patterns.
