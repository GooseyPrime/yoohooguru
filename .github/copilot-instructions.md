## Copilot Response Discipline â€“ CRITICAL

WHEN ASKED A QUESTION BY THE USER:
DO NOT GIVE CONDITIONALS OR "IF" STATEMENTS WHEN THE INFORMATION TO GIVE AN EXACT ANSWER IS ALREADY AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE BY COPILOT.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE USER HAS SET UP AN APP TO FUNCTION WITH KNOWN ARCHITECTURE, DO NOT ANSWER WITH THE "IF" OPTIONS FOR OTHER NONRELEVANT ARCHITECTURES.
IF THE USER ASKS YOU TO LIST OPTIONS WITH OTHER ARCHITECTURES OR PARAMETERS, THEN ANSWER WITH "IF".
ALWAYS GIVE THE EXACT, RELEVANT, AND DIRECT ANSWER BASED SOLELY ON THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE REPOSITORY AND PROJECT CODE/CONFIGURATION.
