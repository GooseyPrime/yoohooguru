## Fixes Applied to yoohoo.guru

### 2. Backend Security: x-powered-by Header ✅

**Issue**: Response included `x-powered-by: express` header
- **Security Risk**: Exposes server technology, making it easier for attackers to target known vulnerabilities
- **Location**: Express.js default behavior

**Fix**:
- Added `app.disable('x-powered-by');` in `backend/src/index.js`
- Added test case in `backend/tests/headers.test.js` to verify header is not exposed
- **Result**: Server no longer exposes technology stack to clients

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/src/index.js` - Added disable statement after app initialization
- `backend/tests/headers.test.js` - Added test case for verification

**Test Result**: ✅ All header tests pass (13/13)

---

### 3. Mobile Experience: theme-color Meta Tag ✅

**Issue**: Missing `theme-color` meta tag for mobile browsers
- **Impact**: Browsers couldn't customize UI chrome (address bar, status bar) to match app theme
- **Browser Support**: Chrome, Edge, Safari (iOS), Samsung Internet

**Fix**:
- Added `<meta name="theme-color" content="#007BFF">` to `frontend/public/index.html`
- Color matches the primary brand color defined in manifest.json
- **Result**: Mobile browsers now display app-themed UI chrome

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/public/index.html` - Added theme-color meta tag
- Already existed in `frontend/public/manifest.json` for PWA

**Browser Compatibility Notes**:
- Firefox: Not supported (informational only, not an error)
- Chrome/Edge/Safari: Fully supported ✅

---

### 4. Accessibility: Viewport Configuration ✅

**Issue Reported**: Viewport should not contain `maximum-scale`
- **Accessibility Impact**: `maximum-scale` prevents users from zooming, violating WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- **Current State**: Our code already follows best practices

**Verification**:
- Checked `frontend/public/index.html` - viewport is correctly configured
- Current: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
- ✅ Does NOT include `maximum-scale`
- ✅ Allows full zoom capability for accessibility

**No Changes Required**: Already compliant with accessibility guidelines.

---

### 5. CSS Compatibility: user-select Property ✅

**Issue Reported**: `user-select` needs `-webkit-user-select` prefix for Safari
- **Location**: Reportedly in `[data-vaul-drawer]` CSS

**Verification**:
- Searched entire codebase for `user-select` usage
- **Result**: Not used in yoohoo.guru codebase
- This error is from external library or site, not our code

**No Changes Required**: Not applicable to our codebase.

---

### 6. Button Accessibility Audit ✅

**Verification Performed**:
- Checked all styled buttons across components
- Verified icon-only buttons have proper accessibility attributes

**Results**:
- ✅ `AccessibilityToolbar` - Toggle button has `aria-label` and `title`
- ✅ `Header` - Mobile menu button has `aria-label`
- ✅ `BookingModal` - Close button has `aria-label`
- ✅ `VideoChat` - All control buttons have `title` attributes
- ✅ All buttons in `ComingSoonPages.js` have visible text content

**Accessibility Score**: All critical buttons meet WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

---

## Testing Performed

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend && NODE_ENV=test npm run jest tests/headers.test.js
```
**Result**: ✅ 13/13 tests passed
- Cache-control headers present
- x-content-type-options present
- x-powered-by header absent (NEW TEST)
- CSP directives correct

### Frontend Build
```bash
cd frontend && FAST_BUILD=true npm run build
```
**Result**: ✅ Build successful
- All webpack optimizations applied
- HTML properly minified
- theme-color meta tag present in output
- viewport configured correctly

## Deployment Recommendations

### Backend
1. ✅ Deploy updated `backend/src/index.js` to production
2. ✅ Verify x-powered-by header is removed using browser DevTools
3. ✅ Test endpoint: `curl -I https://api.yoohoo.guru/health`

### Frontend
1. ✅ Deploy updated `frontend/public/index.html` to Vercel
2. ✅ Verify theme-color in mobile browsers (Chrome DevTools device mode)
3. ✅ Test viewport zoom functionality on mobile devices
