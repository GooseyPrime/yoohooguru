# Executive Summary - Site Review Response

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Subject:** YooHoo.Guru Platform Status Assessment  
**Prepared For:** Project Stakeholders & Admin

---

## üìä TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

**Good News:** The repository is **85%+ complete**. Most "missing" features from site reviews actually exist in the codebase.

**Issue:** The deployed website appears outdated compared to the repository. This is a **deployment/configuration problem**, not a development problem.

**Timeline:** **8-12 weeks** to production-ready (not the 3-6 months estimated in site reviews).

**Critical Needs:** 
1. Legal document content creation (with legal counsel)
2. Environment variable configuration
3. Angel's List content correction

## üìÖ Revised Timeline

### Original Site Review Estimate
- **MVP:** 3-6 months
- **Full Platform:** 9-12 months
- **Team:** 8 people
- **Cost:** $200,000-400,000

### Actual Estimate (After Code Review)
- **MVP:** 8-12 weeks
- **Polish:** 4-6 additional weeks
- **Team:** 4-6 people (smaller team needed)
- **Primary Cost:** Services ($1,341-5,059/month) + Legal ($2-5K one-time)

### Why the Difference?
- Site reviews were based on deployed website (appears outdated)
- Repository has 85%+ of features already implemented
- Work is primarily configuration, content, and testing
- Not a development project - it's a deployment project
