# Legacy Frontend Archive

This directory contains backup and temporary files from the legacy `frontend/` directory that were cleaned up during monorepo restructuring.

## Archived Files

Date: October 21, 2025

### Package.json Backup Files
- `package.json.bak.20250906-235433` (2.3 KB) - Backup from Sept 6, 2025
- `package.json.bak.20250906-235526` (2.3 KB) - Backup from Sept 6, 2025
- `package.json.corrupted` (2.1 KB) - Corrupted package.json file

### Build/Test Output Files
- `build.out` (1.9 KB) - Frontend build output log
- `test.out` (242 bytes) - Test output log

## Why Archived

These files were removed from the active repository to:
1. Clean up workspace configuration (frontend removed from workspaces)
2. Eliminate backup/corrupted files that cause confusion
3. Remove temporary output files that should not be in version control

## Restoration

If any of these files are needed for historical reference:
1. They are preserved here in their original form
2. The package.json.corrupted file shows the state before fix
3. Build/test output files show error messages from that time
