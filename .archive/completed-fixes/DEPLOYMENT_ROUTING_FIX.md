# üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ROUTING FIX

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is **DNS/Routing Configuration**, not just build configuration:

- ‚úÖ `api.yoohoo.guru` ‚Üí Railway backend (correct)  
- ‚ùå `yoohoo.guru` ‚Üí Railway backend (WRONG - should be Vercel)
- ‚úÖ `www.yoohoo.guru` ‚Üí Vercel frontend (correct)

## Why This Causes Different Behavior

1. **yoohoo.guru** hits Railway backend, which:
   - Returns HTML content (if frontend files exist or SERVE_FRONTEND=true)
   - Shows CSP errors because backend CSP headers block frontend assets
   
2. **www.yoohoo.guru** hits Vercel frontend, which:
   - Shows blank screen due to frontend build/configuration issues
   - Has different CSP configuration

## ‚úÖ Complete Fix Required

### 1. DNS Configuration (CRITICAL)
Update DNS records to route `yoohoo.guru` to Vercel:

```
# Current (WRONG)
yoohoo.guru        ‚Üí Railway backend
www.yoohoo.guru   ‚Üí Vercel frontend  
api.yoohoo.guru   ‚Üí Railway backend

# Correct (FIXED)
yoohoo.guru        ‚Üí Vercel frontend  
www.yoohoo.guru   ‚Üí Vercel frontend
api.yoohoo.guru   ‚Üí Railway backend
```

### 2. Railway Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Railway:
```env
SERVE_FRONTEND=false
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGIN_PRODUCTION=https://yoohoo.guru,https://www.yoohoo.guru,https://*.vercel.app
```

### 3. Backend Verification
The backend catch-all should return API-only message when SERVE_FRONTEND=false:

```javascript
// When SERVE_FRONTEND=false, non-API routes return:
{
  "error": "Route Not Found",
  "message": "This is an API-only server. Frontend is deployed separately."
}
```

### 4. Verification Commands

Test routing after DNS changes:

```bash
# Should return JSON (API-only message)
curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://yoohoo.guru/

# Should return JSON (API health check) 
curl https://api.yoohoo.guru/health

# Should return HTML (React app)
curl -H "Accept: text/html" https://www.yoohoo.guru/
```

## üîç Current State Analysis

Based on the backend code, if yoohoo.guru is serving HTML content, it means:

1. **Either**: SERVE_FRONTEND environment variable is not set to `false` in Railway
2. **Or**: DNS is routing yoohoo.guru to Railway instead of Vercel

The fix requires **both** proper environment configuration AND correct DNS routing.

## üìù Action Items

- [ ] Update DNS records to point yoohoo.guru to Vercel
- [ ] Verify Railway environment has SERVE_FRONTEND=false  
- [ ] Test all three domains after DNS propagation
- [ ] Update Vercel frontend to fix blank screen issues
- [ ] Document correct deployment architecture
