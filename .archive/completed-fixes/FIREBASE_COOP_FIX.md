# Firebase COOP Console Errors Fix

## Problem

Firebase authentication with popup (`signInWithPopup`) was generating console errors:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.closed call.
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy policy would block the window.close call.
```

These errors appeared repeatedly during Google authentication popup flows.

## Root Cause

The `vercel.json` configuration had `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` set to `same-origin-allow-popups`, which is too restrictive for Firebase authentication popups.

Firebase's `signInWithPopup` method needs to:
1. Check if the authentication popup window is closed (`window.closed`)
2. Close the popup window after authentication completes (`window.close()`)

The `same-origin-allow-popups` policy blocks these operations when the popup navigates to Firebase/Google OAuth domains (different origins).

## Solution

Changed the COOP header value from `same-origin-allow-popups` to `unsafe-none` in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy",
  "value": "unsafe-none"
}
```

## Why `unsafe-none`?

- **`unsafe-none`**: Disables COOP restrictions completely, allowing full control over popup windows across origins
- **`same-origin-allow-popups`**: Allows opening popups but restricts cross-origin window operations like `window.close()` and `window.closed`
- **`same-origin`**: Most restrictive, blocks all cross-origin window operations

For Firebase popup authentication to work without console errors, we need `unsafe-none` to allow Firebase to manage the popup lifecycle.

## Security Considerations

While `unsafe-none` is less restrictive than `same-origin-allow-popups`, it's the standard configuration for applications using third-party authentication popups (Firebase, OAuth providers, etc.).

The application maintains security through:
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers restricting script sources
- ✅ Firebase authentication validation on the backend
- ✅ HTTPS-only production deployment
- ✅ Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy set to `unsafe-none` (already configured)

## Testing

After this fix:
- ✅ Firebase popup authentication works without console errors
- ✅ Google Sign-in popup opens and closes correctly
- ✅ No COOP policy violations in browser console
- ✅ Authentication flow completes successfully

## Files Modified

- `/vercel.json` - Updated COOP header value
