# Workflow Permissions Fix - Code Scanning Alerts Resolution

## Issue Overview

Multiple code scanning alerts were raised by CodeQL indicating that GitHub Actions workflows did not contain explicit `permissions` blocks. This violates the principle of least privilege and could potentially grant workflows more permissions than necessary.

## Alerts Addressed

This PR fixes the following code scanning alerts:

| Alert # | File | Line | Status |
|---------|------|------|--------|
| #16 | `.github/workflows/autopilot.yml` | 12 | ✅ Fixed |
| #17 | `.github/workflows/copilot-agent.yml` | 13 | ✅ Fixed |
| #18 | `.github/workflows/deployment-control.yml` | 10 | ✅ Fixed |
| #20 | `.github/workflows/autopilot.yml` | 110 | ✅ Fixed |
| #22 | `.github/workflows/autopilot.yml` | 230 | ✅ Fixed |
| #15 | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | 11 | ✅ Fixed in PR #289 |

## Changes Made

### 1. `.github/workflows/autopilot.yml`

Added workflow-level default permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

**Impact**: Sets read-only baseline for all jobs. Jobs that need additional permissions (like `post-action-comment`, `frontend-preview`, and `prod-release`) already have explicit job-level permission blocks that override this default.

### 2. `.github/workflows/copilot-agent.yml`

Added workflow-level default permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

**Impact**: All jobs in this workflow now explicitly run with read-only permissions. The workflow only needs to read repository content and doesn't require write access.

### 3. `.github/workflows/deployment-control.yml`

Added workflow-level default permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

**Impact**: All jobs in this workflow now explicitly run with read-only permissions. This workflow is for deployment checks and doesn't need write access.

## Security Improvements

### Before (Insecure)
Workflows without explicit `permissions` blocks inherit the default GitHub token permissions, which can include:
- Write access to repository contents
- Write access to packages
- Write access to pull requests
- Other potentially unnecessary permissions

### After (Secure)
```yaml
name: Workflow Name

permissions:
  contents: read  # ✅ Explicit read-only default

on:
  ...

jobs:
  job-with-read-only:
    # Inherits workflow-level read-only permissions
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  
  job-with-specific-write:
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write  # ✅ Explicit minimal grant for this job only
    steps:
      - name: Comment on PR
```

## Principle of Least Privilege

The changes follow GitHub Actions security best practices:

1. **Workflow-level default**: Set the most restrictive permissions (`contents: read`) at the workflow level
2. **Job-level overrides**: Allow individual jobs to request additional permissions as needed
3. **Explicit grants**: All permission grants are now explicit and documented in the workflow files

## Jobs with Enhanced Permissions

The following jobs in `autopilot.yml` have job-level permission overrides:

| Job | Permissions | Reason |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| `check-autopilot` | (inherits read-only) | Only reads PR data |
| `post-action-comment` | `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write` | Posts comments and manages labels |
| `verify` | (inherits read-only) | Runs tests and builds |
| `frontend-preview` | `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write` | Builds and posts preview info |
| `backend-check` | (inherits read-only) | Tests backend APIs |
| `prod-release` | `pull-requests: write` | Posts deployment readiness status |

## Verification

✅ **YAML syntax validated** with yamllint
✅ **Job-level permissions preserved** - no functionality lost
✅ **Security posture improved** - explicit least privilege applied
✅ **Follows GitHub best practices** - documented in `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SECURITY.md`
