 This outlines major missing features required for the full vision and the concrete steps to implement them.



Missing Critical Feature                   Discrepancy / Impact                                 Resolution Plan


Production Image/Asset Storage             No dedicated storage solution for user -             Implement Firebase Cloud Storage:       Configure a bucket and update
                                           uploaded profile photos or session media.            the profile API routes to handle image uploads, generating public

Escrow Management Logic                    Funds cannot currently be held in escrow until       Implement Stripe Payment Intent + Webhook Flow:           Utilize Stripe
                                           Gunu satisfaction is confirmed.                      Payment Intents with manual capture, requiring a Gunu confirmation

                                           session/gig.                                         (Firestore Transactions) during booking to ensure atomic capacity
