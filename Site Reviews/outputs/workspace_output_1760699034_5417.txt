User Dashboard UI Specification: The Unified Hub
Objective: Provide a centralized, intuitive, role - based dashboard for all users (Gurus, Gunus, Angels, Basic Users) to manage all
interactions across the three pillars.

Design: Deep Indigo background, Gold accents for active tabs/CTAs, clear iconography, and a responsive, mobile - friendly layout.




1. Dashboard Structure and Navigation
The dashboard uses a fixed navigation structure (horizontal tabs on desktop, vertical sidebar/dropdown on mobile) to switch
between the user's active roles/perspectives.
