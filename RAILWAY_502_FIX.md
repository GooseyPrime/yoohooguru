# Railway 502 Bad Gateway Fix

## Problem Summary
The api.yoohoo.guru endpoint was returning "502 Bad Gateway - application failed to respond" because the Express server was not binding to the correct host interface that Railway expects.

## Root Cause
Railway requires applications to bind to `0.0.0.0` (all network interfaces), but the Express server was using the default binding which only listens on localhost/127.0.0.1 in some configurations.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Server Host Binding (Critical)
Updated `backend/src/index.js` to explicitly bind to `0.0.0.0`:

```javascript
// Before: app.listen(PORT, () => {
// After:
const HOST = process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0';
app.listen(PORT, HOST, () => {
  logger.info(`üéØ ${config.appBrandName} Backend server running on ${HOST}:${PORT}`);
  // ...
});
```

### 2. Favicon Handler (Prevents 502 on favicon requests)
Added explicit favicon route to prevent browser favicon requests from causing 502 errors:

```javascript
app.get('/favicon.ico', (req, res) => {
  // Returns minimal 1x1 transparent GIF with cache headers
  const transparentGif = Buffer.from([...]);
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'image/gif');
  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=86400');
  res.send(transparentGif);
});
```

### 3. Railway Configuration
Updated `nixpacks.toml` to ensure HOST environment variable is set:

```toml
[variables]
SERVE_FRONTEND = "false"
NODE_ENV = "production" 
PORT = "3001"
HOST = "0.0.0.0"  # ‚Üê Added this line
```

## Testing

All changes are covered by tests:
- `tests/favicon.test.js` - Tests favicon handling
- `tests/host-binding.test.js` - Tests host configuration
- `tests/frontend-serving.test.js` - Tests API-only mode (existing)

## Expected Results After Deployment

‚úÖ `https://api.yoohoo.guru/health` should return JSON health status  
‚úÖ `https://api.yoohoo.guru/favicon.ico` should return 200 with GIF image  
‚úÖ No more 502 "application failed to respond" errors  
‚úÖ Server logs should show "Backend server running on 0.0.0.0:3001"

## Chrome Extension Errors (Normal)
The errors about chrome-extension:// files are normal - they're from React DevTools trying to load in production and are not related to the 502 issue.

## Next Steps
After Railway picks up this deployment, verify with:
```bash
curl -I https://api.yoohoo.guru/health
curl -I https://api.yoohoo.guru/favicon.ico  
```

Both should return 200 status codes.
