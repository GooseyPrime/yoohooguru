# Railway 502 Bad Gateway Fix

## Problem Summary
The api.yoohoo.guru endpoint was returning "502 Bad Gateway - application failed to respond" because the Express server was not binding to the correct host interface that Railway expects.

## Root Cause
Railway requires applications to bind to `0.0.0.0` (all network interfaces), but the Express server was using the default binding which only listens on localhost/127.0.0.1 in some configurations.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Main Issue: 502 Bad Gateway (FIXED)
**Problem**: `https://api.yoohoo.guru` returns "502 Bad Gateway - application failed to respond"  
**Cause**: Server not binding to correct host interface for Railway  
**Fix**: Server now binds to `0.0.0.0` explicitly

### 2. Favicon 502 Errors (FIXED)
**Problem**: Browser requests to `/favicon.ico` return 502 errors  
**Cause**: No explicit favicon route handler  
**Fix**: Added favicon route returning minimal transparent GIF

### 3. Chrome Extension Errors (NORMAL - No fix needed)
**Problem**: Console errors like:
```
Could not load content for chrome-extension://gpphkfbcpidddadnkolkpfckpihlkkil/react-devtools-shared/src/isArray.js
```
**Explanation**: These are normal React DevTools extension errors in production. They occur because:
- React DevTools tries to load in production environment
- Extension files are not available in production builds  
- This is expected behavior and not related to the 502 issue
- **No action required** - these can be safely ignored

## Fix Applied

### 1. Server Host Binding (Critical)
Updated `backend/src/index.js` to explicitly bind to `0.0.0.0`:

```javascript
// Before: app.listen(PORT, () => {
// After:
const HOST = process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0';
app.listen(PORT, HOST, () => {
  logger.info(`üéØ ${config.appBrandName} Backend server running on ${HOST}:${PORT}`);
  // ...
});
```

### 2. Favicon Handler (Prevents 502 on favicon requests)
Added explicit favicon route to prevent browser favicon requests from causing 502 errors:

```javascript
app.get('/favicon.ico', (req, res) => {
  // Returns minimal 1x1 transparent GIF with cache headers
  const transparentGif = Buffer.from([...]);
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'image/gif');
  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=86400');
  res.send(transparentGif);
});
```

### 3. Railway Configuration
Updated `nixpacks.toml` to ensure HOST environment variable is set:

```toml
[variables]
SERVE_FRONTEND = "false"
NODE_ENV = "production" 
PORT = "3001"
HOST = "0.0.0.0"  # ‚Üê Added this line
```

## Testing

All changes are covered by tests:
- `tests/favicon.test.js` - Tests favicon handling
- `tests/host-binding.test.js` - Tests host configuration
- `tests/frontend-serving.test.js` - Tests API-only mode (existing)

## Expected Results After Deployment

‚úÖ `https://api.yoohoo.guru/health` should return JSON health status  
‚úÖ `https://api.yoohoo.guru/favicon.ico` should return 200 with GIF image  
‚úÖ No more 502 "application failed to respond" errors  
‚úÖ Server logs should show "Backend server running on 0.0.0.0:3001"  
‚ö†Ô∏è Chrome extension errors will continue (normal behavior)

## Additional Fixes Applied (Sept 30, 2025)

### 4. Missing Non-API Routes (FIXED)
**Problem**: Frontend making requests to `/gurus/` and `/auth/` routes (without `/api/` prefix) causing 502 errors  
**Cause**: Routes only mounted under `/api/` prefix, but frontend expected both patterns  
**Fix**: Mounted guru and auth routes at both API and non-API paths:

```javascript
// Mount routes at both API and non-API paths for frontend compatibility
app.use('/api/gurus', gurusRoutes);
app.use('/gurus', gurusRoutes);
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
app.use('/auth', authRoutes);
```

### 5. CORS OPTIONS Handling (VERIFIED)
**Problem**: All failing requests were OPTIONS (CORS preflight) requests  
**Analysis**: CORS middleware was correctly configured, issue was missing route handlers  
**Result**: With new route handlers, OPTIONS requests now return 204 (success) instead of 502

## Next Steps
After Railway picks up this deployment, verify with:
```bash
curl -I https://api.yoohoo.guru/health
curl -I https://api.yoohoo.guru/favicon.ico  
curl -X OPTIONS -H "Origin: https://yoohoo.guru" https://api.yoohoo.guru/gurus/subdomain/home
curl -X OPTIONS -H "Origin: https://yoohoo.guru" https://api.yoohoo.guru/auth/profile
```

All should return 200/204 status codes instead of 502.
