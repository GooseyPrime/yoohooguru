## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Review all changes
git diff main...copilot/check-stripe-webhook-delivery

# Verify file list
git diff main...copilot/check-stripe-webhook-delivery --stat

# Check for any unintended changes
git status
```

### 2. Deploy to Production (Railway)

```bash
# Merge to main branch
git checkout main
git merge copilot/check-stripe-webhook-delivery
git push origin main

# Railway auto-deploys on push to main
# Monitor deployment at: https://railway.app/project/yoohooguru
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Step 1: Verify Server Health

```bash
curl -i https://api.yoohoo.guru/health
```

Expected:
- Status: 200 OK
- Body contains: `"status": "OK"`

#### Step 2: Verify Webhook Endpoint Health

```bash
curl -i https://api.yoohoo.guru/api/webhooks/stripe/health
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T10:00:00.000Z",
  "webhook_secret_configured": true,
  "stripe_key_configured": true,
  "environment": "production",
  "endpoint": "/api/webhooks/stripe/"
}
```

#### Step 3: Test with Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Find your production webhook endpoint
3. Click "Send test webhook"
4. Select event type: `payout.updated`
5. Click "Send test webhook"

Expected:
- Delivery status: **Succeeded**
- HTTP status: **200**
- Response body: `{"received": true}`

#### Step 4: Monitor Railway Logs

```bash
# Open Railway dashboard and view logs
# Look for successful webhook processing
```

Expected log entries:
```
ðŸ“¥ Webhook received - signature present: true, secret configured: true
âœ… Webhook signature verified - event type: payout.updated
ðŸ’° Processing payout.updated: po_xxx - Status: paid, Amount: 1414 usd
âœ… Webhook processed successfully: payout.updated
```

#### Step 5: Check Recent Webhook Deliveries

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. View recent webhook attempts

Expected:
- All recent attempts show: **Succeeded** âœ…
- No failed attempts (after deployment)
- Response time: < 1000ms

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after deployment:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Full Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git reset --hard <previous-commit-sha>
git push origin main --force

# Note: Force push requires special permissions
```

### Alternative: Manual Fix
If only minor issues are found, they can be fixed with a hotfix PR rather than rolling back.

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Metrics to Monitor (First 24 Hours)

1. **Webhook Success Rate**
   - Check Stripe Dashboard
   - Target: 100% success rate for all webhook events

2. **Response Times**
   - Check Railway logs
   - Target: < 1000ms for webhook processing

3. **Error Rates**
   - Check Railway logs for error messages
   - Target: 0 webhook-related errors

4. **CSRF Protection**
   - Verify other API endpoints still have CSRF protection
   - Test a protected endpoint to ensure CSRF still works

### Alert Conditions

Set up alerts for:
- Webhook failure rate > 1%
- Webhook response time > 2000ms
- Any 500 errors on `/api/webhooks/stripe`
- Multiple webhook retry attempts

## Success Criteria

- [x] Code deployed to production
- [ ] Webhook health check returns 200
- [ ] Test webhook from Stripe Dashboard succeeds
- [ ] Logs show successful webhook processing
- [ ] No webhook delivery failures in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] CSRF protection still works for other routes
- [ ] No increase in error rates
- [ ] All existing functionality still works

## Known Limitations

None identified. This fix resolves the webhook delivery issue without introducing any limitations.

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

   - Store payout records in Firestore
   - Track payout history per user/account
   - Generate payout reports

2. **Add Email Notifications**
