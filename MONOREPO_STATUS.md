# Monorepo Refactor Status

## ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Production

**Status**: 🟢 **MIGRATION COMPLETE**  
**Completion Date**: October 2025  
**Architecture**: Gateway Architecture with Edge Middleware

The yoohoo.guru platform uses a single Vercel project with Edge Middleware routing to support unlimited subdomains. All 29 subdomains (5 core + 24 subjects) are consolidated under `apps/main` and routed via middleware in `apps/main/middleware.ts`.

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Turborepo Setup
- ✅ Installed Turborepo as dev dependency
- ✅ Created `turbo.json` configuration with pipeline for build, dev, lint, and test
- ✅ Updated root `package.json` with monorepo scripts and workspace configuration
- ✅ Created root `tsconfig.json` for all apps to extend

### 2. Gateway Architecture Implementation
All subdomains consolidated under single Next.js app with Edge Middleware routing:

**Core Subdomains (5):**
- ✅ www.yoohoo.guru → `apps/main/pages/_apps/main` - **MIGRATED**
- ✅ angel.yoohoo.guru → `apps/main/pages/_apps/angel` - **MIGRATED**

## 🎯 Production Deployment Status

The monorepo uses a **Gateway Architecture** with a single Vercel project and Edge Middleware routing. All 29 subdomains are served from one deployment.

### Deployment Architecture
- ✅ Single Vercel project (`apps/main`)
- ✅ Edge Middleware routing (`apps/main/middleware.ts`)
- ✅ All subdomain pages under `apps/main/pages/_apps/`
- ✅ Wildcard DNS (`*.yoohoo.guru`) points to one deployment
- ✅ Unlimited subdomain support without project limits

### Deployment Checklist
- ✅ Gateway architecture implemented with Edge Middleware
- ✅ All 29 subdomains configured (5 core + 24 subjects)
- ✅ Shared packages in place (@yoohooguru/shared, @yoohooguru/auth, @yoohooguru/db)
- ✅ Legacy routes redirect to subdomains
- ✅ Documentation complete (README, MONOREPO_README, GATEWAY_ARCHITECTURE)
- ✅ Build system configured with Turborepo
- ✅ Cross-subdomain authentication implemented
- ✅ Environment variable templates created
- ✅ CI/CD workflows updated
- ⏳ Deploy to Vercel (single project for all subdomains)
- ⏳ Test production build
- ⏳ Configure environment variables in Vercel
- ⏳ Add all 29 custom domains to Vercel project
- ⏳ Test cross-subdomain authentication in production

### Deployment Process (Gateway Architecture)
Single Vercel project deployment:
1. Create one Vercel project for `apps/main`
2. Configure:
   - Root directory: `apps/main` (or leave empty)
   - Build command: `cd apps/main && npm run build`
   - Output directory: `apps/main/.next`
3. Set environment variables (shared across all subdomains)
4. Add all 29 custom domains to the single project:
   - www.yoohoo.guru, angel.yoohoo.guru, coach.yoohoo.guru, etc.
5. Deploy once - all subdomains work automatically via middleware

**See [GATEWAY_ARCHITECTURE.md](./GATEWAY_ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete deployment instructions.**

✅ 24 subject subdomain pages created
✅ Legacy routes removed and redirect to subdomains
✅ Documentation complete
✅ Build system configured with Turborepo

## 🔄 Next Steps (User Action Required)

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` at root to link all workspaces
2. **Configure Vercel**: Set up single Vercel project for `apps/main` (see GATEWAY_ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure env vars once in Vercel (shared across all subdomains)
4. **Configure DNS**: Set up wildcard DNS (`*.yoohoo.guru`) pointing to Vercel
5. **Add Domains**: Add all 29 custom domains to the single Vercel project
6. **Deploy**: Deploy once - all subdomains work automatically via middleware
7. **Test**: Verify all subdomains work and authentication flows across subdomains

## 📝 Notes

- The gateway architecture uses Edge Middleware to route all subdomains through a single deployment
- All 29 subdomain pages are under `apps/main/pages/_apps/` directory
- Middleware in `apps/main/middleware.ts` handles subdomain detection and URL rewriting
- All subdomains use the same shared components and styling from `@yoohooguru/shared`
- Authentication is configured for cross-subdomain support (`.yoohoo.guru` cookie domain)
- Backend API remains unchanged - all pages consume the same API endpoints
- No Vercel project limits - can add unlimited subdomains to the single project
