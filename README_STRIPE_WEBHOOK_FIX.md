## Summary

### The Problem (One Line)

CSRF protection was blocking Stripe webhooks because webhooks don't have CSRF tokens.

### The Solution (One Line)

Moved the webhook route to execute BEFORE the CSRF middleware.

### The Impact

‚úÖ All Stripe webhook events now return HTTP 200 (instead of HTTP 500)
‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities introduced
‚úÖ CSRF protection still active for all other routes
‚úÖ Minimal code change (one line moved + event handlers added)

## Quick Verification

After deployment, verify the fix works:

```bash
# 1. Check webhook health
curl https://api.yoohoo.guru/api/webhooks/stripe/health

# 2. Send test webhook from Stripe Dashboard
# Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
# Click: Send test webhook ‚Üí Select payout.updated ‚Üí Send

# 3. Check logs for success message
# Expected: "‚úÖ Webhook processed successfully: payout.updated"
```

## Common Questions

### Q: What exactly was broken?

**A:** All Stripe webhook events were returning HTTP 500 errors because CSRF protection was rejecting them.

### Q: What did you change?

**A:** Moved the webhook route to execute before the CSRF middleware (one line moved in `backend/src/index.js`).

### Q: Will this affect other routes?

**A:** No, CSRF protection still applies to all other API routes. Only webhooks bypass CSRF (which is correct behavior).

### Q: Is this secure?

**A:** Yes, this is the standard security practice for webhooks. Webhooks use signature verification (HMAC-SHA256) instead of CSRF tokens.

### Q: What about payout.updated specifically?

**A:** We also added explicit handling for `payout.updated`, `payout.paid`, and `payout.failed` events with comprehensive logging.

## Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
cd backend
npm test -- webhooks.test.js
```

### Expected Results

- ‚úÖ All existing webhook tests pass
- ‚úÖ New `payout.updated` test passes
- ‚úÖ Webhook returns 200 for all event types
