    CSP and security fixes:
    The previous CSP was too restrictive, causing the browser to block images served from your domain's
    subdomain (`www.yoohoo.guru`). We are now explicitly including your domain to resolve this issue.
    This change should fix the blocked favicon and other local images.

    Performance fix for @keyframes:
    The original animation was using 'height' and 'width', which can cause a full page relayout on every frame,
    leading to performance issues. We've replaced this with 'transform: scale()' and 'opacity', which are much
    more performant as they are handled by the GPU. This change should address the reported performance warnings.
    While the original animation is likely in a different file, adding this style block to your main HTML file
    is the fastest way to get a fix in place.
