    CSP and security fixes:
    The original CSP was very specific and causing issues with a few local resources.
    I have updated it to be a bit more permissive while remaining secure.
    Specifically, the 'img-src' directive has been streamlined to allow images from the same origin,
    and a few unnecessary domains have been removed to improve security. This should fix the blocked
    favicon and yoohooguruyetiman.png images.

    Performance fix for @keyframes:
    The original animation was using 'height' and 'width', which can cause a full page relayout on every frame,
    leading to performance issues. We've replaced this with 'transform: scale()' and 'opacity', which are much
    more performant as they are handled by the GPU. This change should address the reported performance warnings.
    While the original animation is likely in a different file, adding this style block to your main HTML file
    is the fastest way to get a fix in place.
