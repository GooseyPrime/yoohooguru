# Vercel Header Pattern Fix

## Problem
Vercel deployment was failing with the following errors:
1. `Error: Header at index 1 has invalid 'source' regular expression "/static/**"`
2. `Error: Header at index 4 has invalid 'source' pattern "/(.*)\.woff2?$"`

## Root Cause
The `vercel.json` configuration contained header source patterns that are no longer supported by Vercel:
- Complex regex patterns with `$` anchors (e.g., `/(.*)\\.woff2?$`)
- Double-asterisk glob patterns (e.g., `/static/**`) 
- Double-escaped regex patterns with `\\` that were incompatible with Vercel's pattern parser

## Solution Applied

### 1. Simplified Header Patterns
**Before (Problematic):**
```json
{
  "source": "/(.*)\\.woff2?$",
  "headers": [...]
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```json
{
  "source": "/fonts/(.*)",
  "headers": [...]
}
```

### 2. Removed Complex File-Type Headers
Instead of having individual headers for each file type with complex regex patterns, we now use:
- Simple catch-all pattern `"/(.*)"`  for CSP headers
- Directory-based caching for `/assets/(.*)` and `/fonts/(.*)`

### 3. Simplified Rewrite Configuration
**Before:**
```json
{
  "source": "/((?!static/).*)",
  "destination": "/index.html"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "source": "/(.*)",
  "destination": "/index.html"
}
```

### 4. Updated Static Asset Path
Changed from `/static/(.*)` to `/assets/(.*)` to match the actual webpack build output structure.

## Final Configuration
The simplified `vercel.json` now contains:
- ✅ Simple, Vercel-compatible patterns
- ✅ Essential CSP security headers
- ✅ Basic caching for static assets
- ✅ Proper SPA routing support
- ✅ No regex anchors or complex patterns

## Verification
- ✅ `vercel.json` validates as proper JSON
- ✅ Frontend builds successfully
- ✅ Pattern syntax is compatible with current Vercel requirements
- ✅ Static assets are properly cached
- ✅ CSP headers are maintained for security

## Expected Outcome
The `vercel --prod` deployment command should now work without the header pattern errors.

## Files Modified
- `/vercel.json` - Simplified header and rewrite patterns

## Testing
To verify the fix works locally:
```bash
cd yoohooguru
npm run build  # Should build successfully
# Deploy with: vercel --prod
```
