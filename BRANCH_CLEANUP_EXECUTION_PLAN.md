# Branch Cleanup Execution Plan

## Summary
This document provides the final execution plan for cleaning up the excessive active branches in the GooseyPrime/yoohooguru repository.

## ⚠️ Repository Rule Blocking Deletion

**Issue**: An active repository ruleset "automatic code review" (ID: 7846257) prevents all branch deletions.

**Details**:
- Ruleset applies to `~ALL` branches
- Contains `deletion` rule blocking all branch deletions
- Current user bypass: `never`
- Status: `active`

**Required Resolution**: 
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/GooseyPrime/yoohooguru/rules/7846257
2. Temporarily disable the ruleset OR modify it to exclude `copilot/fix-*` branches
3. Proceed with branch cleanup
4. Re-enable the ruleset after cleanup

## Current State
- **Total copilot/fix-* branches found**: 87 (updated from previously documented 66)
- **Branches to preserve**: main, fix-ci-env, dependabot/npm_and_yarn/npm_and_yarn-580af77ce8
- **Analysis completed**: ✅ All safety checks passed
- **Documentation updated**: ✅ All references to old branches fixed

## Ready-to-Execute Solutions (After Resolving Repository Rules)

### Option 1: Automated Script Execution (Recommended)
```bash
# With COPILOT_PAT token already configured
./scripts/cleanup-copilot-branches.sh delete
```

### Option 2: Git Command Line (Bulk Deletion)
```bash
# Execute the generated git commands
./scripts/cleanup-copilot-branches.sh git
# Then run the commands from copilot-branch-git-commands.txt
```

### Option 3: GitHub Web Interface (Manual)
Navigate to: https://github.com/GooseyPrime/yoohooguru/branches
- Delete each copilot/fix-* branch individually
- Keep main, fix-ci-env, and dependabot branches
- Most reliable but time-consuming for 87 branches

### Option 4: GitHub API (Programmatic)
```bash
# Generate curl commands with proper authentication
./scripts/cleanup-copilot-branches.sh generate
# Execute commands from copilot-branch-cleanup-commands.txt with COPILOT_PAT
```

## Verification Steps
After executing any deletion method:

1. **Verify cleanup**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cleanup-copilot-branches.sh verify
   ```

2. **Check remaining branches**:
   ```bash
   git branch -r | grep copilot/fix
   # Should return no results
   ```

3. **Confirm preserved branches**:
   - ✅ main (default branch)
   - ✅ fix-ci-env (non-copilot branch)
   - ✅ dependabot/npm_and_yarn/npm_and_yarn-580af77ce8

## Files Updated
- ✅ `COPILOT_BRANCH_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Updated with accurate branch count and additional findings
- ✅ `scripts/cleanup-copilot-branches.sh` - Added all 87 branches and new git command generation
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Added cleanup artifact files
- ✅ Generated `copilot-branch-git-commands.txt` - Ready-to-execute git commands

## Risk Assessment: LOW ✅
- All safety checks completed
- No critical dependencies found
- Documentation properly updated
- CI/CD unaffected
- Main development workflow preserved

## Next Steps
1. **Resolve Repository Rules** - Disable or modify ruleset at https://github.com/GooseyPrime/yoohooguru/rules/7846257
2. **Choose execution method** (Option 1 recommended for efficiency)
3. **Execute branch deletion** - Can be done immediately after rule resolution
4. **Run verification commands**
5. **Re-enable repository rules** if they were temporarily disabled
6. **Clean up temporary command files**
7. **Update issue status to closed**

---
**Status**: Ready for execution (blocked by repository rules)  
**Estimated time**: 2-5 minutes for bulk deletion after rule resolution  
**Prerequisites**: Repository admin access to modify rules, COPILOT_PAT token (✅ available)
