# Branch Cleanup Execution Plan

## Summary
This document provides the final execution plan for cleaning up the excessive active branches in the GooseyPrime/yoohooguru repository.

## Current State
- **Total copilot/fix-* branches found**: 87 (updated from previously documented 66)
- **Branches to preserve**: main, fix-ci-env, dependabot/npm_and_yarn/npm_and_yarn-580af77ce8
- **Analysis completed**: ✅ All safety checks passed
- **Documentation updated**: ✅ All references to old branches fixed

## Ready-to-Execute Solutions

### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Manual)
Navigate to: https://github.com/GooseyPrime/yoohooguru/branches
- Delete each copilot/fix-* branch individually
- Keep main, fix-ci-env, and dependabot branches
- Most reliable but time-consuming for 87 branches

### Option 2: Git Command Line (Recommended)
```bash
# Execute the generated git commands
./scripts/cleanup-copilot-branches.sh git
# Then run the commands from copilot-branch-git-commands.txt

# Or execute directly:
git push origin --delete \
  copilot/fix-0c1aa775-f2d4-40c2-987a-3f665724b394 \
  copilot/fix-8f68c49c-e0d5-4fd2-a78c-fa49513ca79b \
  # ... (all 87 branches)
```

### Option 3: GitHub API (Bulk)
```bash
# Generate curl commands
./scripts/cleanup-copilot-branches.sh generate
# Execute commands from copilot-branch-cleanup-commands.txt
```

### Option 4: GitHub CLI (If Available)
```bash
# If gh CLI is authenticated
./scripts/cleanup-copilot-branches.sh delete
```

## Verification Steps
After executing any deletion method:

1. **Verify cleanup**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cleanup-copilot-branches.sh verify
   ```

2. **Check remaining branches**:
   ```bash
   git branch -r | grep copilot/fix
   # Should return no results
   ```

3. **Confirm preserved branches**:
   - ✅ main (default branch)
   - ✅ fix-ci-env (non-copilot branch)
   - ✅ dependabot/npm_and_yarn/npm_and_yarn-580af77ce8

## Files Updated
- ✅ `COPILOT_BRANCH_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Updated with accurate branch count and additional findings
- ✅ `scripts/cleanup-copilot-branches.sh` - Added all 87 branches and new git command generation
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Added cleanup artifact files
- ✅ Generated `copilot-branch-git-commands.txt` - Ready-to-execute git commands

## Risk Assessment: LOW ✅
- All safety checks completed
- No critical dependencies found
- Documentation properly updated
- CI/CD unaffected
- Main development workflow preserved

## Next Steps
1. Choose execution method (Option 2 recommended for efficiency)
2. Execute branch deletion
3. Run verification commands
4. Clean up temporary command files
5. Update issue status to closed

**Status**: Ready for execution  
**Estimated time**: 5-10 minutes for bulk deletion  
**Prerequisites**: Repository admin access or authenticated git session
